## 📖 Documentation

### Environment Support

**Supported Configurations:**
- ✅ Hybrid (On-premises AD + Entra ID)
- ✅ On-premises only (AD without cloud)
- ✅ Cloud-focused (Entra ID primary)

**ADATT automatically detects:**
- User exists in Entra ID → Full cloud operations
- User on-premises only → AD operations only
- Hybrid user → Both AD and cloud operations

### Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Try with test accounts before production
2. **Backup**: Have account recovery process ready
3. **Permissions**: Verify admin rights before bulk operations
4. **Communication**: Inform HR before terminations
5. **Documentation**: Review generated reports for compliance

### Security Considerations

- ADATT requires admin credentials (never stored)
- All actions are logged for audit compliance
- License files encrypted with Windows DPAPI
- No data sent to external servers (except license validation)
- Offline grace period: 30 days
